# Tips
<small>(Who needs a wiki when you can just spend your evening making a static site generator?)</small>

Just a bundle of neat lil tech things I wanted to document _somewhere_.

## Firefox

### Allowing extensions to access restricted sites
By default, Firefox prevents extensions from accessing or modifying the content of sites under domains such as addons.mozilla.org. You can remedy this by doing the following:
1. Go to about:config
2. Find `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains`
3. Set it to an empty string

### (Selectively) Disabling HSTS/HPKP
<small>(Source: <https://wiki.mozilla.org/SecurityEngineering/Public_Key_Pinning#How_to_use_pinning>)</small>
1. Go to about:config
2. Find `security.cert_pinning.enforcement_level`
3. Set it to:
   * `0` to entirely disable HSTS
   * `1` to disable HSTS if the certificate is signed by a user-added CA
   * `2` to fully enable HSTS

### Enabling the ability to manually add search engines
<small>(Copied from [a Fediverse post](https://bark.lgbt/@rail_/112321713076445218) by [rail](https://bark.lgbt/@rail_))</small>
1. Go to about:config
2. Find `browser.urlbar.update2.engineAliasRefresh`
3. Set it to `true`

### Mobile: Enabling about:config on production builds
<small>(Copied from [a Fediverse post](https://exquisite.social/@thomholwerda/112795429303595558) by [Itanium Thom](https://exquisite.social/@thomholwerda))</small>
1. Go to chrome://geckoview/content/config.xhtml
2. Find `general.aboutConfig.enable`
3. Set it to `true`

### Mobile: Enabling third-party CA certificates
1. Go to the three-dot menu, and tap Settings
2. Scroll down to the bottom, and tap "About Firefox"
3. Tap the Firefox logo five times
4. Go back, and tap "Secret Settings"
5. Enable "Use third party CA certificates"

## Matrix

### Changing your room-specific display name or avatar
Fun fact: Matrix has functionality for you to set your display name and/or avatar, but only for one room. This way, I can use something like "BlankEclair [she/her]" as my "default" display name, but then set it to something like "Claire" in a more personal chat.

#### Instructions for nheko
1. Open a room
2. Click on the members icon (if unencrypted) or the shield icon (if encrypted) on the top-right of the program
3. Click on your user account
4. Click on the edit/pencil icons next to your name and/or your avatar, like so:
   ![A screenshot of a room-specific user profile. The profile has a display name of "BlankEclair [she/her]", a Matrix ID of "@blankeclair:catgirl.cloud", and the room it is in is named "Random Stuff". The mouse cursor is currently hovering over the edit icon next to the display name, which has a tooltip above it that reads "Change display name. Will only apply to this room."](/tips_images/matrix/change-room-profile/nheko.png)

#### Instructions for Element Android
1. Open a room
2. Type /myroomnick and/or /myroomavatarâ€”you should see something like the following:
   ![A screenshot of the message box inside a room in Element. Entered in the message box is the string "/myroom", to which there are two auto-completed commands above. The first command reads "/myroomnick <display-name>: Changes your display nickname in the current room only", and the second commands reads "/myroomavatar <mxc_url>: Changes your avatar in this current room only"](/tips_images/matrix/change-room-profile/element.png)
