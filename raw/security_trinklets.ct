# Security Trinklets
<small>In which Claire accidentally finds her third security vulnerability while trying to fix a bug</small>

Dates shown are when I reported the issue

* 2024-06-01: Citizen: Stored XSS in MediaWiki:Tagline ([CVE-2024-36123], [GHSA-jhm6-qjhq-5mf9])

  Due to accidentally calling `Message::text()` (which returns unparsed wikitext) instead of `Message::parse()` (which returns parsed wikitext as HTML), an administrator can edit MediaWiki:Tagline to inject an XSS payload for Citizen users

  [CVE-2024-36123]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36123
  [GHSA-jhm6-qjhq-5mf9]: https://github.com/StarCitizenTools/mediawiki-skins-Citizen/security/advisories/GHSA-jhm6-qjhq-5mf9

* 2024-07-08: CSS: CSS sanitization bypass through @import ([CVE-2024-47845], [T368594])

  Due to using a function not meant for sanitizing CSS files, anyone who can edit pages can add a crafted CSS file that loads another CSS file from a remote server, bypassing sanitization and leaking the viewer's IP address along the way

  (Originally discovered by [Bawolff](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Bawolff/) on 2024-06-27)

* 2024-07-08: CSS: Path traversal when loading local stylesheets ([CVE-2024-47841], [T369486])

  Due to inadequete URL parsing, it is possible to use backslashes to avoid the path traversal being detected and prevented while still having spec-compliant browsers travel one folder up.

  [T369486]: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T369486

* 2024-07-22: Cargo: Users can call arbitrary SQL functions ([CVE-2024-47849], [T370632])

  Due to the regex used for detecting SQL functions not handling backticks, a user can inject backticks without Cargo noticing and preventing the query, allowing it to pass through the database

  [T370632]: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T370632

* 2024-08-11: Cargo: No CSRF protection on Special:DeleteCargoTable and Special:SwitchCargoTable ([CVE-2024-47846], [T372209])

  Due to Cargo not checking the CSRF token (also called an "edit token" in MediaWiki), administrators can be tricked into deleting and switching in tables by simply travelling to a link with the "delete" or "switch" URL query parameter

  [CVE-2024-47846]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47846
  [T372209]: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T372209

* 2024-08-11: Cargo: Various stored, reflective, and DOM-based XSSes (primarily requiring high privileges, but some with low or none as well) ([CVE-2024-47847], [T372211])

  Due to a systemic lack of escaping, users and administrators alike can inject XSS payloads

  [T372211]: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T372211

* 2024-09-28: Citizen: Stored, self-XSS in user "real name" setting ([CVE-2024-47536], [GHSA-62r2-gcxr-426x])

  Due to a lack of escaping, a user can XSS themselves by setting an XSS payload in their "real name" field

  [CVE-2024-47536]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47536
  [GHSA-62r2-gcxr-426x]: https://github.com/StarCitizenTools/mediawiki-skins-Citizen/security/advisories/GHSA-62r2-gcxr-426x

* 2024-10-01: DataDump: Stored XSS in Special:DataDump when outputting dump status ([CVE-2024-47612], [GHSA-h8x8-24c7-r2rj], [T12670])

  Due to a lack of escaping, an administrator can edit some interface messages to XSS those who can view Special:DataDump

  [CVE-2024-47612]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47612
  [GHSA-h8x8-24c7-r2rj]: https://github.com/miraheze/DataDump/security/advisories/GHSA-h8x8-24c7-r2rj
  [T12670]: https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12670

* 2024-10-04: CreateWiki: Stored XSS in Special:RequestWikiQueue when displaying sitename ([CVE-2024-47781], [GHSA-h527-jh77-5g7j], [T12693])

  Due to a lack of escaping, anyone who can request a wiki (the ability of which is freely granted to new users) can set an XSS payload as their requested wiki name

  [CVE-2024-47781]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47781
  [GHSA-h527-jh77-5g7j]: https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/security/advisories/GHSA-h527-jh77-5g7j
  [T12693]: https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12693

* 2024-10-04: WikiDiscover: Stored XSS in Special:WikiDiscover when displaying wiki information ([CVE-2024-47782], [GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf], [T12697])

  Due to a lack of escaping, anyone who can modify a wiki's name and description (which is easy to achieve, since it is relatively simple to create a wiki) can XSS anyone who views Special:WikiDiscover

  [CVE-2024-47782]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47782
  [GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf]: https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf
