# Welcome to my spidersite!
<small>(Get it? Spidersite? Website? I have no idea if this joke makes sense or not)</small>

I'm Claire (she/her), though I also go by BlankEclair. I'm also referred to as Eclair, or Blankâ€”I don't really mind that much as long as I know you're referring to me.

I'm a bisexual transfemme <s>masochist</s> programmer, and my current obsessions include maintaining the [Rainverse Wiki](https://rainverse.wiki), helping out technically on [Miraheze](https://miraheze.org) globally, and reading [_My Impossible Soulmate_](https://rainverse.wiki/wiki/My_Impossible_Soulmate),

I am also apparently cursed (seriously, has there been a thing I've used that does not have a bug?), but to make up for it I can apparently <s>cast magic</s> write and read (reasonable) regular expressions.
